# Angular Motoko and Azle

Welcome to the Angular Motoko and Azle Github repo!
This repository is made to be a plug-and-play solution for using Angular16 as an ICP smart contract canister front-end with Motoko as the canister back-end. <br />
This project uses Angular version 17.1 and dfx 0.15.3.

A special thanks to https://github.com/JupiterM/Angular16Motoko for the base Angular implementation.

## Quickstart

run git clone 'https://github.com/nparcher24/angular-dfx-azle-ii'. <br />
cd angular-dfx-azle-ii. <br />
run 'npm install -y'. <br />
run 'npm run deploy:local'.
run 'ng serve'

## Deploy on IC Network

This has not been implemented yet. Working on it...
